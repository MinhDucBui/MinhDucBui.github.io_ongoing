### Personal summary

> Hi! I am an enthusiastic data scientist with a keen interest in Natural Language Processing. My journey towards the field of 
> data science started when I pursued my undergraduate degree in "Mathematics in Business and Economics", where I developed a 
> fascination for Machine Learning and its intricacies. To further pursue my passion, I pursued a master's degree in 
> "Data Science" from the University of Mannheim. During my studies, I had the opportunity to work as a working student at 
> SAP and as a research assistant under the guidance of Prof. Dr. GlavaÅ¡ at the NLP Chair at the University of Mannheim. 
> Currently, I am working as a Data Scientist in the field of Autonomous Driving at Bosch, where I am able to apply 
> my skills and knowledge to tackle real-world challenges.
